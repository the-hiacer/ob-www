Hardware Wanted
</h2>

<hr>

<p>
The following list outlines hardware that the OpenBSD project could use.
There are a number of reasons why developers need hardware, and it is important
to first of all realize these reasons:

<ul>
<li>To support a specific device, normally one which is more rare or new.
<li>To be part of their development environment.
<li>Some types of machines may be different in some way
    (i.e. big-endian or unsigned-char) and ensure that developers
    write code more carefully.
<li>That said, space or power may be at a premium for some people.
</ul>

<p>
If you do not own these devices, but want to help us, we recommend you
search on <a href="http://www.ebay.com">eBay</a> for the devices.  If
you do the bidding and then get the device shipped to us, it really
helps us.  It is better if developers develop, and skip the bidding process,
since any time saved can be spent on improving OpenBSD instead.

<p>
If it is clear which specific developer should be contacted, please do
so directly.  Otherwise contact <a href="mailto:deraadt@openbsd.org">Theo de Raadt</a>
who will pass on the message to whichever developers are in need.

<p>
Please be very clear as to where you are located!!  For larger items this
can be very important.

<h3>General device requirements</h3>

<p>
We try to spread these types of devices around our development community.

<ul>
<li>Laptops.  These die often enough that as a group our needier
    developers need help replacing about 2-3 per year.
<li>Apple Mac powerpc equipment.
<li>HP J6750 machines (J6700 is the second best choice).
<li>Faster &amp; smaller sparc64 machines, for instance 1U rack mount
    machines.  It is important to spread sparc64 around the development
    community, since it is the most strict platform for detecting non-portable
    or buggy code.
<li>Any amd64 or faster i386 hardware which comes available.
<li>We generally do not need older and "very common" ISA/PCI equipment, since
    our developers will generally have gotten their hands on these in the
    past.
</ul>

<h3>Trunk/LACP Support for the Data Center</h3>

<p>
Carlos Cardenas (in United States) is working on LACP support for data
center deployments.  This requires each host to have a LACP trunk to two
switches that are in a MLAG configuration.  This developer would like the
following hardware to help development:

<ul>
  <li>2 x Arista DCS-7150S-24, 24-Port 10G SFP+, AC Power
  <li>2 x Arista OEM 10G SFP+ SR Optics (LC Connections)
  <li>2 x Arista OEM 1.5m 10G SFP+ DAC Cables
  <li>2 x Arista OEM 1.5m 10G SFP+ AOC Cables
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>2 x Edge-Core AS5712-54X with Cumulus Linux, 48-Port 10G SFP+, AC Power
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>2 x Cisco C3172PQ-10GX, 48-Port 10G SFP+, AC Power
  <li>2 x Cisco OEM 10G SFP+ SR Optics (LC Connections)
  <li>2 x Cisco OEM 1.5m 10G SFP+ DAC Cables
  <li>2 x Cisco OEM 1.5m 10G SFP+ AOC Cables
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>2 x Juniper QFX5100-48S, 48-Port 10G SFP+, AC Power
  <li>2 x Juniper OEM 10G SFP+ SR Optics (LC Connections)
  <li>2 x Juniper OEM 1.5m 10G SFP+ DAC Cables
  <li>2 x Juniper OEM 1.5m 10G SFP+ AOC Cables
</ul>

<h4>Notes when contributing switches</h4>

<p>
To help the developer integrate the hardware quickly,

<ul>
  <li>Please ensure all cables match the developer's locale (US plugs)
  <li>PSUs are AC Power unless explicitly requesting DC
  <li>Software/Firmware versions are the same on each pair of switches.
      Version discrepancies can prevent MLAG from working.
</ul>
