<h3>What's New</h3>
<p>
This is a partial list of new features and systems included in OpenBSD 6.7.
For a comprehensive list, see the <a href="plus67.html">changelog</a> leading
to 6.7.

<ul>

<li>General improvements and bugfixes:
  <ul>
    <li>Reduced the minimum allowed number of chunks in a CONCAT
	volume from 2 to 1, increasing the number of volumes which can be
	created on a single disk with <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/bioctl">bioctl(8)</a> from 7 to 15. This
	can be used to create more partitions than previously.
    <li>Rewrote the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/cron">cron(8)</a>
	flag-parsing code to be getopt-like, allowing tight formations like
	-ns and flag repetition. Renamed the "options" field in <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/crontab.5">crontab(5)</a> to "flags".
    <li>Added <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/man5/crontab.5">crontab(5)</a> -s flag
	to the command field, indicating that only a single instance of the
	job should run concurrently.
    <li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/cron">cron(8)</a>
	support for random time values using the ~ operator.
    <li>Allowed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/cwm">cwm(1)</a>
	configuration of window size based on percentage of the master window
	during horizontal and vertical tiling actions.
    <li>Allowed use of window-htile and window-vtile with the "empty"
	group clients in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/cwm">cwm(1)</a>.
    <li>Switched powerpc to a machine-independent mplock implementation,
	allowing use of <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/witness">
	witness(4)</a>.
    <li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/acpi">acpi(4)</a>
	support for the _CCA method, indicating whether DMA is cache-coherent.
    <li>Switched the default compiler on powerpc to clang.
    <li>Bumped <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/nvme">nvme(4)</a> max
	physio() i/o size to 128K.
    <li>Improved <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/apmd">apmd(8)</a>
	support for automatic suspend/hibernate (-z/-Z).  The daemon now
	reacts to power changes messages sent by the battery driver.
	Those messages are ignored for 60 seconds after a resume, so
	that the user can take control before the machine goes back to
	sleep.
    <li>Prevented a kernel hang when no unlocked ffs_softdep worklist
	items could be processed.
    <li>Stopped counting pages mapped as PROT_NONE against the
	RLIMIT_DATA limit, helping code which reserves large chunks of address
	space but populates it sparsely.
    <li>Added the $REQUEST_SCHEME variable to <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/httpd.conf">httpd.conf(5)</a>, allowing
	preservation of the original connection type (http or https) for
	redirect locations
    <li>Implemented "strip" option in <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/httpd.conf">httpd.conf(5)</a> for
	fastcgi to be able to have multiple chroots under /var/www for FastCGI
	servers.
    <li>Changed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/httpd">httpd(8)</a>
	to send a 408 response when a timeout happens while headers are being
	received, but close the connection if no request is received.
    <li>Updated en_US.UTF-8.src to Unicode 12.1.
    <li>Added a new __tmpfd system call which creates a new, unnamed file in
	/tmp, intended for shm/fd passing, but in programs that may otherwise
	lack filesystem access (due to restrictions imposed by
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/unveil.2">unveil(2)</a> or
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pledge.2">pledge(2)</a>).
    <li>Imported <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dt">dt(4)</a>, a
	driver and framework for Dynamic Profiling, and an accompanying bug
	tracer that speaks the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dt">dt(5)</a>
	language.
    <li>Added a human-readable mode (-h) to <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/systat">systat(1)</a>.
    <li>Implemented scrolling in <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/top">top(1)</a> using the 9 and 0 keys.
    <li>Added <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/timeout_set_flags">timeout_set_flags(9)</a>
	and TIMEOUT_INITIALIZER_FLAGS(9) to the timeout API, allowing the
	caller to initialize timeouts with arbitrary flags.
    <li>Introduced TIMEOUT_SCHEDULED flag and tos_scheduled statistic
	to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/timeout.9">timeout(9)</a>.
    <li>Switched to tickless backend in <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/timeout.9">timeout(9)</a>, adding new
	interface <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/timeout_add_ts">timeout_add_ts(9)</a> to
	avoid backwardly compatible behavior.
    <li>Added the system clock interface <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/nanoboottime">nanoboottime(9)</a>,
	returning the UTC time at which the system booted in seconds and
	nanoseconds.
    <li>Introduced efficient page freeing in reverse order from uvm,
	greatly improving cases of massive page freeing.
    <li>Added uvm_objfree to uvm to efficiently free all pages from a
	uvm object, used in the buffer cache for considerable speedup when
	freeing pages.
    <li>Modified buffer cache to use individual uvm_objs per buffer to
	speed page lookups.
    <li>Speed up <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sort">sort(1)</a> by
	not performing a top-level sort when -c is used with a -k field.
    <li>Modified -z mode verification in <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/signify">signify(1)</a> to save the
	header and output it, so signify -zV >saved.tgz will keep the
	signature for later checks.
    <li>Enabled DNSSEC validation in <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/unbound">unbound(8)</a> by default.
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ntpd">ntpd(8)</a> now does
	constraint validation against 9.9.9.9 and 2620:fe::fe by default.
    <li>Fixed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/arp.4">arp(4)</a>
	issues created by <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhclient.8">dhclient(8)</a>
	modifying existing routes.
    <li>Fixed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/resolv.conf.5">resolv.conf(5)</a>
	handling by <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhclient.8">dhclient(8)</a>
	when an interface loses link.
    <li>Restored previous <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhclient.8">dhclient(8)</a>
	behaviour of rejecting leases that lack a subnet mask.
    <li>Enabled <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhclient.8">dhclient(8)</a>
	to configure <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/carp.4">carp(4)</a>
	interfaces.

	""</code>.
    <li>A background scan is now triggered when root runs the <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig">ifconfig(8)</a> scan command.
	This updates the list of cached APs displayed by the scan command and
	forces a search for a better AP to roam to.
    <li>Add <code>nwflag nomimo</code> which can be set with <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig">ifconfig(8)</a> to work
	around packet loss in 11n mode if the wireless network device has
	unused antenna connectors.

    <li>Fix kernel crashes in net80211 hostap mode due to mbuf corruption
	which occurred if a relatively long SSID was configured.
    <li>Added support for active scanning to <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/bwfm">bwfm(4)</a>.
    <li>Fix <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bwfm">bwfm(4)</a> behavior which
	could trigger the ifq pressure drop mechanism under moderate load.
    <li>Improved error handling for <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/bwfm">bwfm(4)</a> connection attempts.
    <li>Improved automatic switching between wifi networks by lowering the priority
	of networks in the <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig">ifconfig(8)</a> join list which
	fail to connect.
    <li>Avoid repeated switching between APs in areas where APs
	are tuned for low transmit range.
    <li>Raised net80211's "beacon miss" threshold to avoid frequent
	reconnects under conditions which cause loss of beacons.
    <li>Reduced stalls on packet loss in 11n mode by improving net80211 handling
	of the Rx block ack sequence number window and queue.
    <li>Fixed a bug where outstanding frames on the <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/iwn">iwn(4)</a> aggregation queue
	interfered with roaming to another AP.
    <li>Fixed a race condition in <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/iwm">iwm(4)</a> Rx interrupt handling.
    <li>Implemented a workaround for missing Tx completion interrupts
	in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iwm">iwm(4)</a> which could lead
	to failures when roaming to another AP.
    <li>Re-enabled firmware-based Tx retries at lower rates for <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/iwm">iwm(4)</a>, reducing packet loss.
    <li>Fixed automatic Tx rate control issues in <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/iwm">iwn(4)</a>, and <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/iwm">iwm(4)</a>.

  <ul>

    <li>Fixed a panic when using <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pppac">
	pppac(4)</a> without <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pipex">pipex(4)</a>.
    <li>Fixed a "route contains no arp information" bug where a kernel routing
	table entry was incorrectly deleted upon insertion of a new entry.
    <li>Stopped processing packets under non-exclusive netlock, preventing
	concurrency in the socket layer.
    <li>Prevented data corruption on UDP receive socket buffers by grabbing the

	href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf">pf(4)</a> to function as specified
	in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.conf">pf.conf(5)</a>.
    <li>Prevented non-root users from using <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/ioctl">ioctl(2)</a> to alter the address
	of a network interface.

	advertisement is from a neighbor's address, not required in accordance
	with RFC 4861.

  </ul>

<li>Installer improvements:
  <ul>
    <li>Simplified <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysupgrade">sysupgrade(8)</a> directory
	check and creation (/home/_syspatch). It can now be a symlink.
    <li>Printed the URL when <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysupgrade">sysupgrade(8)</a> fetches
	new sets.
    <li>Added an opportunistic run of <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/fw_update">fw_update(1)</a> to <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysupgrade">sysupgrade(8)</a> before
	rebooting to run the upgrade.
  </ul>

<li>Security improvements:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/unveil.2">unveil(2)</a> is
      now used in 82 userland programs to redact filesystem access.
    <li>Used <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/unveil">unveil(2)</a> to
	reduce filesystem access in <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmstat">vmstat(8)</a>, <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/iostat">iostat(8)</a> and <a

	bind(8) source code and cleaned up the source code by removing not
	needed features and auditing it. The kernel API accessible to these
	programs is now restricted through <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/pledge">pledge(2)</a>.
    <li>System calls may now only be performed from selected code regions:
	the main program, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ld.so">ld.so(1)</a>,
	libc.so and the signal trampoline. A new system call
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/msyscall">msyscall(2)</a> indicates
	the libc range, and activates the locking.  This change hardens
	against some attack methods.
    <li>Prevented stack trace saving from inspecting untrusted data on
	amd64, arm64 and i386.
    <li>Used lfence in place of stac/clac on pre-SMAP CPUs to protect

	latency.
    <li>Enforced that <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ksh">ksh(1)</a>
	TMOUT is an integer literal to prevent command execution from the
	environment at shell initialization time.
    <li>Ensured the first 2MB page of the amd64 kernel is correctly
	mapped read-only in the direct map.
    <li>Addressed an armv7/arm64 speculative execution issue by changing the
	system call ABI to skip two instructions and inserting a barrier
	after each system call.
    <li>Fixed arm64 speculative execution of instructions after ERET,
	which had led to spectre-like effects on some processors.
    <li>Tightened permissions for USB device nodes.
    <li>Ensured that <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/ld.so">ld.so(1)</a> removed the
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable for set-user-ID and set-group-ID
	executables in low memory conditions.
    <li>Added support for RSA-PSS to <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/crypto">crypto(3)</a>.
    <li>Added retguard for octeon/mips64.

    <li>The following security bugs were addressed:
      <ul>
	<li>Reset the login class each time through the loop when using -L
	    (loop) mode with <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/su">su(1)</a>. Fixes
	    CVE-2019-19519.
	<li>Fixed insufficient username validation performed by libc's
	    authentication privilege separation layer and added additional
	    validation points, further validating in <a
	    href="https://man.openbsd.org/login">login(1)</a> and <a
	    href="https://man.openbsd.org/su">su(1)</a>.
	<li>Prevented escalation to the auth group in <a
	    href="https://man.openbsd.org/xlock">xlock(1)</a> through path-related
	    environment variables and disabled mesa and opengl functionality.
      </ul>
  </ul>

<li>Routing daemons and other userland network improvements:
  <ul>
<!-- bgpd -->
    <li>Add initial support for JSON output in
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bgpctl">bgpctl(8)</a>.

	    all moduli generation options to under the -O flag. Breaks existing
	    ssh-keygen commandline syntax for moduli-related operations.
	<li>Allowed forwarding of a different agent socket to a specified
	    path in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh">ssh(1)</a>.
	<li>Allowed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh">ssh(1)</a> security
	    keys to act as host keys as well as user keys.
	<li>Used ssh-sk-helper for all security key signing operations and
	    security key enrollment. Most <a
	    href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh">ssh(1)</a> tools no longer need to
	    link against libfido2 or interact with /dev/uhid* directly.
	<li>Added "no-touch-required" options to <a
	    href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen">ssh-keygen(1)</a> and <a
	    href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd">sshd(8)</a> to disable touch
	    requirement for authorized_keys and certificates.
	<li>Added an <a
	    href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config">sshd_config(5)</a>
	    PubkeyAuthOptions directive allowing specification of whether <a
	    href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd">sshd(8)</a> should check whether
	    user presence was tested before a security key was made.
        <li>Added direct support for U2F/FIDO2 security keys in <a
	    href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh">ssh(1)</a>.
        <li>Added initial infrastructure for U2F/FIDO support in <a
	    href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh">ssh(1)</a>.
	<li>Notified the user via TTY or $SSH_ASKPASS when <a
	    href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh">ssh(1)</a> security keys must be
	    tapped/touched in order to perform a signature operation.
	<li>Enabled ed25519 support in <a
	    href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh">ssh(1)</a>.
      </ul>
    <li>Bugfixes
      <ul>
	<li>Detected and prevented simple <a
	    href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh">ssh(1)</a> configuration loops when
	    using ProxyJump.
	<li>Fixed PIN entry bugs on FIDO in <a
	    href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen">ssh-keygen(1)</a>.
	<li>Fixed <a
	    href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen">ssh-keygen(1)</a> not
	    displaying the authenticator touch prompt.
	<li>Prevented a timeout in <a
	    href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh">ssh(1)</a> when the server doesn't
	    immediately send a banner, such as with multiplexers like sslh.
	<li>Adjusted on-wire signature encoding for ecdsh-sk <a
	    href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh">ssh(1)</a> keys to better match
	    ec25519-sk keys.
	<li>Fixed a potential NULL dereference for revoked hostkeys in <a
	    href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh">ssh(1)</a>.
	<li>ssh(1): fix IdentitiesOnly=yes to also apply to keys loaded from
	    a PKCS11Provider
	<li>ssh-keygen(1): avoid NULL dereference when trying to convert an
	    invalid RFC4716 private key.
	<li>scp(2): when performing remote-to-remote copies using "scp -3",
	    start the second ssh(1) channel with BatchMode=yes enabled to
	    avoid confusing and non-deterministic ordering of prompts.
 	<li>ssh(1): fix incorrect error message for "too many known hosts
	    files."
	<li>ssh(1): make failures when establishing "Tunnel" forwarding
	    terminate the connection when ExitOnForwardFailure is enabled
	<li>ssh-keygen(1): fix printing of fingerprints on private keys and add
	    a regression test for same.
	<li>sshd(8): document order of checking AuthorizedKeysFile (first) and
	    AuthorizedKeysCommand (subsequently, if the file doesn't match)
	<li>sshd(8): document that /etc/hosts.equiv and /etc/shosts.equiv are
	    not considered for HostbasedAuthentication when the target user is
	    root
	<li>ssh(1), ssh-keygen(1): fix NULL dereference in private certificate
	    key parsing (oss-fuzz #20074).
	<li>ssh(1), sshd(8): more consistency between sets of %TOKENS are
	    accepted in various configuration options.
	<li>ssh(1), ssh-keygen(1): improve error messages for some common
	    PKCS#11 C_Login failure cases
	<li>ssh(1), sshd(8): make error messages for problems during SSH banner
	    exchange consistent with other SSH transport-layer error messages
	    and ensure they include the relevant IP addresses
	<li>various: fix a number of spelling errors in comments and debug/error
	    messages
 	<li>ssh-keygen(1), ssh-add(1): when downloading FIDO2 resident keys
	    from a token, don't prompt for a PIN until the token has told us
	    that it needs one. Avoids double-prompting on devices that
	    implement on-device authentication.
 	<li>sshd(8), ssh-keygen(1): no-touch-required FIDO certificate option
	    should be an extension, not a critical option.
 	<li>ssh(1), ssh-keygen(1), ssh-add(1): offer a better error message
	    when trying to use a FIDO key function and SecurityKeyProvider is
	    empty.
	<li>ssh-add(1), ssh-agent(8): ensure that a key lifetime fits within
	    the values allowed by the wire format (u32). Prevents integer
	    wraparound of the timeout values
	</ul>
  </ul>

<li>Mandoc 1.14.6
  <ul>
    <li>Introduced a new <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/mdoc">mdoc(7)</a> macro .Tg ("tag") to
	explicitly mark a place as defining a term, and improved automatic
	tagging in various ways.
    <li>Print the manpath when the <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/man.1#w">man(1) -w</a> option
	is given without an argument, for compatibility with the man-1.6
	and man-db implementations.
    <li>Deleted support for the <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.6/man.conf.5#_whatdb"
	>_whatdb</a> configuration directive from
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/man.conf.5">man.conf(5)</a>
	five years after it was declared obsolete; use <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/man.conf.5#manpath">manpath</a> instead.
    <li>Added a Content-Security-Policy HTTP header to <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/man.cgi.8">man.cgi(8)</a>
	that allows only CSS.
    <li>Provide a STYLE message when <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/mandoc.1">mandoc(1)</a> knows the
	filename and the extension disagrees with the section number
	given in the .Dt or .TH macro.
    <li>When the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mdoc.7">mdoc(7)</a> .Dd
	macro lacks an argument, use the empty string, and always
	concatenate all arguments, no matter their number.
	The same change was applied to groff.
  </ul>

<li>Ports and packages:
<p>The package system provides an easy way to install 3rd party software. New features include:
  <ul>
    <li>Provide debug package information that can be installed
	alongside packages and used to provide better bug reports.
    <li>Added DEBUG_PKG_CACHE functionality to <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/pkg_add">pkg_add(1)</a>, fetching debug
	patches when packages are installed.
    <li>Added a -d option to <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/pkg_add">pkg_add(1)</a> to add debug
	packages if present alongside intended updates or additions.
    <li>Added support for "alpha" suffixes in <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/packages-specs">packages-specs(7)</a>,
	removing the need for workarounds in certain ports distfiles.
  </ul>

  <p>Many pre-built packages for each architecture:

<section id=quickinstall>
<p>
Quick installer information for people familiar with OpenBSD, and the use of
the "<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/disklabel.8">disklabel</a> -E" command.
If you are at all confused when installing OpenBSD, read the relevant
INSTALL.* file as listed above!

<h3>OpenBSD/alpha:</h3>

<p>
If your machine can boot from CD, you can write <i>install67.iso</i> or
<i>cd67.iso</i> to a CD and boot from it.
Refer to INSTALL.alpha for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/amd64:</h3>

<p>
If your machine can boot from CD, you can write <i>install67.iso</i> or
<i>cd67.iso</i> to a CD and boot from it.
You may need to adjust your BIOS options first.

<p>
If your machine can boot from USB, you can write <i>install67.fs</i> or
<i>miniroot67.fs</i> to a USB stick and boot from it.

<p>
If you can't boot from a CD, floppy disk, or USB,
you can install across the network using PXE as described in the included
INSTALL.amd64 document.

<p>
If you are planning to dual boot OpenBSD with another OS, you will need to
read INSTALL.amd64.

<h3>OpenBSD/arm64:</h3>

<p>
Write <i>miniroot67.fs</i> to a disk and boot from it after connecting
to the serial console.  Refer to INSTALL.arm64 for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/armv7:</h3>

<p>
Write a system specific miniroot to an SD card and boot from it after connecting
to the serial console.  Refer to INSTALL.armv7 for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/hppa:</h3>

<p>
Boot over the network by following the instructions in INSTALL.hppa or the
<a href="hppa.html#install">hppa platform page</a>.

<h3>OpenBSD/i386:</h3>

<p>
If your machine can boot from CD, you can write <i>install67.iso</i> or
<i>cd67.iso</i> to a CD and boot from it.
You may need to adjust your BIOS options first.

<p>
If your machine can boot from USB, you can write <i>install67.fs</i> or
<i>miniroot67.fs</i> to a USB stick and boot from it.

<p>
If you can't boot from a CD, floppy disk, or USB,
you can install across the network using PXE as described in
the included INSTALL.i386 document.

<p>
If you are planning on dual booting OpenBSD with another OS, you will need to
read INSTALL.i386.

<h3>OpenBSD/landisk:</h3>

<p>
Write <i>miniroot67.fs</i> to the start of the CF
or disk, and boot normally.

<h3>OpenBSD/loongson:</h3>

<p>
Write <i>miniroot67.fs</i> to a USB stick and boot bsd.rd from it
or boot bsd.rd via tftp.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.loongson for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/luna88k:</h3>

<p>
Copy 'boot' and 'bsd.rd' to a Mach or UniOS partition, and boot the bootloader
from the PROM, and then bsd.rd from the bootloader.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.luna88k for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/macppc:</h3>

<p>
Burn the image from a mirror site to a CDROM, and power on your machine
while holding down the <i>C</i> key until the display turns on and
shows <i>OpenBSD/macppc boot</i>.

<p>
Alternatively, at the Open Firmware prompt, enter <i>boot cd:,ofwboot
/6.7/macppc/bsd.rd</i>

<h3>OpenBSD/octeon:</h3>

<p>
After connecting a serial port, boot bsd.rd over the network via DHCP/tftp.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.octeon for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/sgi:</h3>

<p>
To install, burn cd67.iso on a CD-R, put it in the CD drive of your
machine and select <i>Install System Software</i> from the System Maintenance
menu. Indigo/Indy/Indigo2 (R4000) systems will not boot automatically from
CD-ROM, and need a proper invocation from the PROM prompt.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.sgi for more details.

<p>
If your machine doesn't have a CD drive, you can setup a DHCP/tftp network
server, and boot using "bootp()/bsd.rd.IP##" using the kernel matching your
system type. Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.sgi for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/sparc64:</h3>

<p>
Burn the image from a mirror site to a CDROM, boot from it, and type
<i>boot cdrom</i>.

<p>
If this doesn't work, or if you don't have a CDROM drive, you can write
<i>floppy67.fs</i> or <i>floppyB67.fs</i>
(depending on your machine) to a floppy and boot it with <i>boot
floppy</i>. Refer to INSTALL.sparc64 for details.

<p>
Make sure you use a properly formatted floppy with NO BAD BLOCKS or your install
will most likely fail.

<p>
You can also write <i>miniroot67.fs</i> to the swap partition on
the disk and boot with <i>boot disk:b</i>.

<p>
If nothing works, you can boot over the network as described in INSTALL.sparc64.

<h3>How to upgrade</h3>
<p>
If you already have an OpenBSD 6.6 system, and do not want to reinstall,
upgrade instructions and advice can be found in the
<a href="faq/upgrade67.html">Upgrade Guide</a>.
</section>

<hr>

<section id=sourcecode>
<h3>Notes about the source code</h3>
<p>
<code>src.tar.gz</code> contains a source archive starting at <code>/usr/src</code>.
This file contains everything you need except for the kernel sources,
which are in a separate archive.
To extract:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>mkdir -p /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>cd /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/src.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
<code>sys.tar.gz</code> contains a source archive starting at <code>/usr/src/sys</code>.
This file contains all the kernel sources you need to rebuild kernels.
To extract:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>mkdir -p /usr/src/sys</kbd>
# <kbd>cd /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/sys.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Both of these trees are a regular CVS checkout.  Using these trees it
is possible to get a head-start on using the anoncvs servers as
described <a href="anoncvs.html">here</a>.
Using these files
results in a much faster initial CVS update than you could expect from
a fresh checkout of the full OpenBSD source tree.
</section>

<hr>

<section id=ports>
<h3>Ports Tree</h3>
<p>
A ports tree archive is also provided.  To extract:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>cd /usr</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/ports.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Go read the <a href="faq/ports/index.html">ports</a> page
if you know nothing about ports
at this point.  This text is not a manual of how to use ports.
Rather, it is a set of notes meant to kickstart the user on the
OpenBSD ports system.
<p>
The <i>ports/</i> directory represents a CVS checkout of our ports.
As with our complete source tree, our ports tree is available via
<a href="anoncvs.html">AnonCVS</a>.
So, in order to keep up to date with the -stable branch, you must make
the <i>ports/</i> tree available on a read-write medium and update the tree
with a command like:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>cd /usr/ports</kbd>
# <kbd>cvs -d anoncvs@server.openbsd.org:/cvs update -Pd -rOPENBSD_6_7</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
[Of course, you must replace the server name here with a nearby anoncvs
server.]
<p>
Note that most ports are available as packages on our mirrors. Updated
ports for the 6.7 release will be made available if problems arise.
<p>
If you're interested in seeing a port added, would like to help out, or just
would like to know more, the mailing list
<a href="mail.html">ports@openbsd.org</a> is a good place to know.
